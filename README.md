# 2D-Adventure

This was a project created for my Computer Graphics class to help learn the fundamentals of Canvas2D. When I hear the phrase "2D Adventure", the first thing that comes to mind is any of the 2D Zelda games. A lot of the choices I made during this project were made in homage to the original Legend of Zelda.

The core deliverables of the project were:
- Breaking a Canvas into 64x64 tiles. (I decided to do 16x11 tiles, as that was the playable resolution of Zelda I.)
- Creating one player, and at least three different types of monsters.
- Handling character movement.
- Collision checking based on tile location.
- Collding with a monster attacks it, and vice-versa.
- Potions to restore health.
- Check for "Game Over" or "You Win", and display a screen.
- Give the hero and monsters certain properties, such as:
  - Health
  - Max Health
  - Attack
  - Defense
  - Location
  - Picture
- Rendering a health bar for the hero and monsters.
- Object-Oriented Concepts in JavaScript

Content I added:
- Multiple Screens
- Screen Scrolling
- Enemy Drops
- Attack-Boosting Item
- Defense-Boosting Item
- Different AI Types
- Loading Game Data from JSON
- Level Mapping in JSON

This has been a really fun project to work on.
